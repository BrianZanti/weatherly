### Reflections
I removed my Welcome component. In the end, it was just a header element that accepted a message as a prop, so instead I implemented it as a header to keep things simpler. 

I really wanted to add functionality to display the suggested names when the city/state was not found. It feels wrong to have the app just say can't find your location when it has suggestions, but in the end I decided to leave it alone and only do what was asked.
